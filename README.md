Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Sales Data Analysis for a gift and floral business, modeled on FNP (Flowers N Gifts).
The core output is an interactive dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel, utilizing raw sales, product, and customer data to deliver actionable insights.
The analysis focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Revenue, Order Quantity, and customer demographics to understand sales drivers and trends.

Key Features of the Dashboard
1. Interactive Controls: The dashboard features slicers (e.g., for Gender, Month, Location) allowing users to dynamically filter and view data.
2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Displays total revenue, total orders, and average order delivery time.
3. Revenue Analysis: Visualizations break down revenue by Product Category (e.g., Cake, Soft Toys, Sweets, Plants) and Occasion (e.g., Diwali, Valentine's Day, Anniversary).
4. Geographical and Temporal Insights: Analysis includes revenue by City and sales trends over Time (Months).
5. Customer Insights: Visualization of revenue segmented by Gender to understand different customer bases.

Techniques Used
1. Data Cleaning and Transformation: Preparing raw data from multiple tables (customers, orders, products) for analysis.
2. Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts: Utilized for data aggregation and creating the visual components of the dashboard.
3. Excel Formulas: Used for calculating custom metrics and ensuring data integrity.
4. Slicers: Implemented for creating a user-friendly, interactive experience.
